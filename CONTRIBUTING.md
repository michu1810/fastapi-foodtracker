Thanks for your interest in contributing!
This project is **public and non-commercial** (CC BY-NC 4.0 license). Pull Requests are welcome.
The repository owner retains full control over what is merged into `main`.

## How to submit changes
1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `dev`:
   `git checkout -b feat/feature-name`
2. Make your changes + tests.
3. Run lint/tests locally (if configured).
4. Submit a **Pull Request** to `dev` with a description of *what* and *why*.
5. PRs require **review**. After approval, they are merged into `dev` and later into `main`.

## PR guidelines
- Keep PRs small and focused (easier review).
- PR description: "What changes", "Why", "How to test".
- Do not bump dependencies without justification.
- Do not commit secrets (.env).
- Do not add binaries/assets > 2 MB without prior approval.

## Code style
- Frontend: **React + TypeScript + Tailwind**.
- Python (backend): follow **PEP8**.
- Accessibility matters (aria-*, focus states).

## Reporting bugs
- Create an issue with minimal reproduction steps, logs, and browser/OS version.

## Security
- Do **not** post security vulnerabilities in public issues â€” see `SECURITY.md`.
