### üöÄ Running Locally

The entire project is containerized, allowing for a one-command setup.

#### Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/michu1810/fastapi-foodtracker.git](https://github.com/michu1810/fastapi-foodtracker.git)
    cd fastapi-foodtracker
    ```

2.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create `.env` files in the `foodtracker/` and `frontend/` directories based on the `.env.example` files found there. Fill them with the required keys (e.g., for OAuth2, database, Cloudinary).

3.  **Build and run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

### <details><summary>üéØ Project Mission (Click to expand)</summary>

Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted. In Poland alone, this figure is close to 5 million tons. We throw food away because we forget about expiration dates, buy too much, or plan poorly. I decided to leverage my technical skills to create a tool that actively helps combat this ubiquitous problem at the individual level.

**Food Tracker** is my answer to this challenge. It is a fully functional web application that I designed and built from scratch to give users a simple and effective way to manage their home pantry, save money, and care for our planet. This repository is not just code‚Äîit's a demonstration of my approach to building complex, secure, and efficient full-stack systems.

### <details><summary>üõ°Ô∏è Backend Architecture - A Deep Dive (Click to expand)</summary>

When designing the backend architecture, I set several key goals: **security, performance, and scalability**. Below are the most important technical decisions I made to achieve them:

-   **API Design (FastAPI):** I chose the asynchronous framework **FastAPI** to ensure extremely high performance and low latency, even under heavy load. I utilized the built-in **Dependency Injection** system to manage database sessions and user authentication.

-   **Authentication and Security:** I implemented authentication based on **JWTs**. The long-lived `refresh_token` is stored in a secure **`HttpOnly` cookie**, which is an industry standard for protection against **XSS** attacks. User passwords are protected with the strong, adaptive **bcrypt** algorithm.

-   **API Rate Limiting:** Implemented request throttling using **`slowapi`** to protect endpoints against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts, enhancing application security and stability.

-   **Asynchronous Background Tasks (Celery):** Sending emails and periodically checking expiration dates are delegated to **Celery** asynchronous tasks. This ensures the API remains responsive at all times. **Celery Beat** acts as a built-in scheduler, guaranteeing the automation of key processes.

-   **Database (PostgreSQL & SQLAlchemy):** I opted for a fully **asynchronous database stack** with `asyncpg` and `AsyncSession` in SQLAlchemy. To manage database schema changes, I used **Alembic**, which provides versioning and ensures safe migrations. Financial values are stored using the precise **`Decimal`** type to avoid rounding errors.

-   **Containerization (Docker):** The entire application is containerized using **Docker**, with separate, optimized configurations for development (`docker-compose.yml`) and production (`docker-compose.prod.yml`). For enhanced security, the processes inside the containers run as a **non-root user**.

-   **Secure File Storage (Cloudinary):** User avatars are validated on the backend by their **MIME type** (using `python-magic`) before being uploaded to **Cloudinary**, an external, scalable object storage service. This offloads the application server and ensures fast, secure media delivery.

### <details><summary>üß™ Automated Testing - A Solid Foundation (Click to expand)</summary>

-   **Code Quality & Linting:** The entire codebase is formatted and validated using **Ruff**, the state-of-the-art Python linter and formatter. This ensures high code quality, consistency, and adherence to best practices across the project.
-   **Code Coverage:** I aim for the highest possible code coverage (currently around 85-90%), with a strong focus on achieving 100% coverage for critical modules like authentication.
-   **Framework:** The entire test suite is based on **Pytest**, leveraging its advanced features like fixtures and parametrization.
-   **Test Types:**
    -   **Unit tests** for business logic (e.g., the achievement system, helper functions).
    -   **Integration tests** for the API, using an isolated, in-memory SQLite database for speed and reliability.
    -   **Mocking** of external and asynchronous services (e.g., email dispatch, Cloudinary API, Celery tasks).
-   **Automation (CI/CD):** A process using **GitHub Actions** automatically runs the linter (`ruff check`) and the entire test suite after every commit, ensuring constant quality control and measuring code coverage with **Codecov**.

This comprehensive testing approach allows me to develop the application quickly and safely, confident that its foundations are solid and reliable.
